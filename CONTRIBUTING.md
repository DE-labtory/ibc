### How to contribute

1. Fork [https://github.com/DE-labtory/ibc](https://github.com/DE-labtory/ibc)
2. Register issue you are going to work, and discuss with maintainers whether this feature is needed. Or you can choose existing issue.
3. After assigned the issue, work on it.
4. Document about your code.
5. Test with `go test -v ./...`
6. Format your code with `goimports -w ./` commands.
7. After passing tc and formatting, create pr to `develop` branch referencing issue number.
8. Passing travis-ci with more than one approve from maintainers, you can **rebase and merge** to the develop branch.
9. After passing all the tc, no build error we can merge to `master` branch at milestone.
